HTML 
basics 
assignment 


You 
might 
have 
heard 
that 
in 
modern 
web 
development 
developers 
usually 
use 
HTML, 
CSS 
and 
Javascript 
to 
make 
websites. 
HTML 
creates 
the 
structure 
for 
the 
content 
in 
the 
website, 
CSS 
creates 
the 
styling 
and 
makes 
the 
website 
to 
look 
good 
and 
Javascript 
creates 
the 
functionality 
for 
the 
website. 
First 
we 
focus 
on 
HTML. 
HTML 
(Hypertext 
Markup 
Language) 
is 
a 
language 
that 
is 
used 
create 
for 
example, 
titles, 
paragraphs, 
lists 
and 
tables 
and 
a 
lot 
more 
in 
websites. 


MDN 
has 
many 
great 
tutorials 
and 
guides 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
web 
development 
and 
in 
this 
assignment 
you 
can 
use 
this 
Introduction 
to 
HTML 
tutorial 
for 
help 
if 
you 
need 
it.

on 
your 
website.

different 
ways.

</ol>
Example: 



9. 
Links 
are 
also 
important 
part 
of 
the 
web 
desing. 
You 
can 
use 
them 
to 
navigate 
your 
own 
website 
and 
also 
connect 
your 
website 
to 
other 
websites. 
Write 
a 
link 
that 
opens 
a 
new 
tab 
and 
leads 
into 
Google.com 
with 
the 
text 
“Link 
to 
Google”. 
Answer: 


<ahref="https://www.google.com"target="_blank">LinktoGoogle</a>

Images 
and 
videos 


10. 
Most 
webpages 
have 
images 
so 
it’s 
good 
to 
know 
how 
to 
add 
images 
in 
HTML. 
Write 
the 
tag 
that 
is 
used 
to 
add 
images. 
If 
you 
want 
to 
try 
this 
out 
in 
a 
HTML 
document 
you 
can 
use 
“https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Flower_poster_2.jpg/1200pxFlower_
poster_2.jpg” 
(Picture 
of 
some 
flowers) 
as 
the 
image 
source. 
You 
can 
scale 
the 
picture 
with 
width 
and 
height 
(in 
pixels). 
Answer: 


<img 


src="Source 
to 
your 
picture" 


/> 


Source 
can 
be 
pointing 
to 
a 
web 
resource 
or 
into 
a 
local 
image 
file. 
HTML 
document 
just 
needs 
to 
know 
from 
where 
to 
get 
the 
image 
file. 


11. 
Videos 
have 
become 
more 
prevelent 
on 
the 
web 
and 
many 
websites 
also 
have 
some 
video 
content. 
Write 
the 
tag 
to 
add 
embedded 
videos 
to 
a 
website 
with 
the 
source 
“linktovideo.mp4”. 
Answer: 


<video 


src="linktovideo.mp4" 


poster="any 
thumbnail 
picture 
i 
want 
as 
picture" 
> 


</video> 


If 
you 
want 
to 
use 
a 
thumbnail 
for 
your 
video, 
you 
have 
to 
provide 
source 
for 
the 
poster 
attribute. 
This 
works 
the 
same 
way 
as 
img 
tags 
src 
attribute. 
You 
can 
checkout 
the 
attributes 
for 
the 
video 
tag 
from 
here.

Tables 


12. 
Tables 
are 
another 
useful 
way 
to 
display 
information 
for 
your 
users. 
Write 
the 
tag 
that 
encloses 
the 
whole 
table, 
the 
tag 
that 
encloses 
a 
row, 
the 
tag 
for 
headers 
and 
the 
tag 
for 
table 
cell. 
Answer: 


<table></table> 
<tr></tr> 
<th></th> 
<td></td> 


13. 
Let’s 
first 
create 
a 
simple 
table. 
Write 
a 
table 
with 
two 
headers: 
“Title 
1” 
and 
“Title 
2”, 
first 
row: 
“Item 
1” 
and 
“Item 
2”, 
second 
row: 
“Item 
3” 
and 
“Item 
4”. 
Answer: 


<table> 


<tr> 
<th>Title 
1</th> 
<th>Title 
2</th> 


</tr> 


<tr> 
<td>Item 
1</td> 
<td>Item 
2</td> 


</tr> 


<tr> 
<td>Item 
3</td> 
<td>Item 
4</td> 


</tr> 
</table> 


Example:

14. 
Then 
we 
can 
try 
to 
create 
more 
complicated 
table 
to 
see 
how 
to 
use 
different 
features 
of 
tables. 
Recreate 
above 
table. 
Hint: 
You 
change 
how 
many 
rows 
or 
columns 
a 
cell 
spans 
by 
adding 
rowspan 
or 
colspan 
to 
th 
or 
td 
tag. 
You 
can 
add 
borders 
by 
adding 
“style=‘border: 
1px 
solid 
black; 
border-collapse: 
collapse;’” 
to 
the 
table 
tag 
and 
“style=‘border: 
1px 
solid 
black;’ 
” 
to 
th 
and 
td 
tags. 
Answer: 


<table

border-collapse: 
collapse;">

This 
table 
is 
not 
the 
best 
way 
to 
display 
this 
information, 
because 
it 
might 
be 
confusing 
for 
anyone 
using 
a 
screen 
reader, 
but 
we 
will 
come 
back 
to 
these 
kinds 
of 
issues 
when 
we 
talk 
more 
about 
accessibility 
of 
websites.

Forms 


Forms 
are 
important 
part 
of 
web 
development. 
It 
gives 
you 
a 
way 
to 
interact 
with 
user 
data, 
but 
also 
opens 
your 
site 
to 
security 
problems 
that 
you 
have 
to 
take 
into 
account. 
Right 
now 
we 
will 
focus 
on 
how 
to 
create 
a 
basic 
form 
that 
user 
can 
use 
to 
input 
some 
data. 


In 
these 
tasks 
you 
can 
use 
this 
web 
form 
tutorial 
as 
help 
if 
you 
need 
it. 


15. 
Let’s 
start 
with 
the 
basic 
tags 
for 
web 
forms. 
Write 
the 
tag 
that 
encloses 
the 
form, 
the 
tag 
for 
input 
label 
and 
tag 
for 
the 
input. 
Answer: 


<form></form> 
<label></label> 
<input> 


16. 
HTML 
gives 
you 
tools 
to 
tell 
what 
kind 
of 
information 
should 
go 
into 
different 
inputs. 
Write 
tag 
for 
input 
that 
is 
meant 
for 
email 
type 
input. 
Answer: 


<input 
type="email"> 


11 



17. 
Now 
we 
can 
create 
a 
basic 
form. 
Write 
a 
form 
with 
labels 
and 
input 
boxes 
for 
“Name:”, 
“Email:” 
and 
“Phone:”. 
Hint: 
You 
can 
use 
<br> 
tag 
as 
line 
break. 
Answer: 


<form>
<label>Name:</label>
<inputtype="text">
<br>
<label>Email:</label>
<inputtype="email">
<br>
<label>Phone:</label>
<inputtype="tel">
</form>
Example: 



12 



18. 
The 
form 
needs 
also 
submit 
functionality 
so 
that 
user 
can 
submit 
their 
information. 
Add 
a 
basic 
submit 
button 
to 
the 
form 
you 
just 
made. 
Answer: 


<form> 
<label>Name:</label> 
<input 
type="text"> 
<br> 


<label>Email:</label> 
<input 
type="email"> 
<br> 


<label>Phone:</label> 
<input 
type="tel"> 
<br> 
<br> 


<button 
type="submit">Submit</button> 
</form> 


Example: 



13 



19. 
Sometimes 
you 
might 
want 
to 
give 
the 
user 
ability 
to 
write 
longer 
texts 
in 
the 
input. 
Add 
a 
multiline 
text 
area 
with 
the 
label 
“Message:” 
under 
the 
“Phone”. 
Answer: 


<form> 
<label>Name:</label> 
<input 
type="text"> 
<br> 


<label>Email:</label> 
<input 
type="email"> 
<br> 


<label>Phone:</label> 
<input 
type="tel"> 
<br> 


<label>Message:</label> 
<textarea></textarea> 
<br> 
<br> 


<button 
type="submit">Submit</button> 
</form> 


Example: 



20. 
Check 
through 
the 
HTML5 
input 
types 
so 
that 
you 
know 
how 
versitile 
the 
input 
tag 
can 
be.
