Hobby Page
We all have different hobbies. Let’s say you are assigned (or choose yourself) to create a small
webpage to convince more people to start with your hobby.
Create a small webpage in HTML where you talk about a hobby (related to sports, music,
programming, gaming, culture…) you have. Include images and videos and try to make it
enticing for the reader to start with the hobby.

Try to incorporate several of the elements we’ve discussed (lists, tables, definitions,
and abbreviations…). You’re also welcome to add HTML elements you find here:
